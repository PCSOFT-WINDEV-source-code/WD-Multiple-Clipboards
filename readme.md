<span style="font-family:Arial sans-serif;font-size:14px;">The WD Multiple Clipboard example automatically manages a multi-level clipboard between all the WINDEV applications started on the computer.</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial sans-serif;font-size:14px;">The copy operation can be performed from any application, regardless whether it was developed in WINDEV or not. The text and bitmap formats will be stored.</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial sans-serif;font-size:14px;">The special paste is triggered via \[CTRL\]+\[SHIFT\]+\[V\] and a popup window is displayed at the location of the input cursor. Then, the user only has to choose the history entry that he wants to paste. </span>

<span style="font-family:Arial sans-serif;font-size:14px;">The content of the clipboard is stored on disk in case the application stops. Therefore, the application can be placed in the startup group of the user in order to get a clipboard whose content is persistent even after the computer is switched off.</span>
